# Arduino Happy Birthday Project

## Project Overview
This project displays a "Happy Birthday" message on an 8x8 matrix, plays a melody with a buzzer, and blinks LEDs in sync with the music.

## Required Components
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- **8x8 LED Matrix** with MAX7219 driver
- **Buzzer**
- **5 LEDs**
- **220Ω Resistors** (for LEDs)
- **Breadboard** and **Jumper Wires**

## Libraries to Install
- **MaxMatrix**: Available on GitHub or through the Arduino Library Manager.

## Wiring Connections
- **Arduino - MAX7219**
  - Data (DIN or MOSI) -> D10
  - Load (CS) -> D9
  - Clock (SCK) -> D8

- **Arduino - Buzzer**
  - Buzzer Pin -> D11

- **Arduino - LEDs**
  - **LED1**: Anode -> 220Ω resistor -> D3, Cathode -> GND
  - **LED2**: Anode -> 220Ω resistor -> D4, Cathode -> GND
  - **LED3**: Anode -> 220Ω resistor -> D5, Cathode -> GND
  - **LED4**: Anode -> 220Ω resistor -> D6, Cathode -> GND
  - **LED5**: Anode -> 220Ω resistor -> D7, Cathode -> GND

## Steps to Upload the Code
1. **Connect Arduino**: Plug your Arduino board into your computer using a USB cable.
2. **Open Arduino IDE**: Launch the Arduino IDE on your computer.
3. **Load the Code**: Open the `.ino` file that you downloaded.
4. **Select Board and Port**: In the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port under the "Tools" menu.
5. **Upload the Code**: Click on the "Upload" button (right arrow icon) to upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Project Setup
1. **Assemble the Hardware**: Connect all components according to the wiring connections section.
2. **Power the Arduino**: Ensure that the Arduino is powered either through the USB connection or an external power source.

## Testing the Project
- **Check LED and Buzzer Operation**: Verify that the LEDs blink and the buzzer plays the melody as intended.
- **Matrix Display**: Confirm that the 8x8 matrix displays the "Happy Birthday" message and then the second message correctly.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Display on Matrix**: Check the wiring connections, ensure the MAX7219 driver is properly connected.
- **No Sound from Buzzer**: Verify the buzzer connection and ensure the pin number is correct in the code.
- **LEDs Not Working**: Ensure proper resistor placement and check the wiring for each LED.
